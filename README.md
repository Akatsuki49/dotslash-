## How It Works!

padh.AI is built using Flutter for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, OpenAI's CPT-3.5 turbo for querying, FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) library in python for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and Firebase for authentication. 
Here's how it works:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users can sign up or log in using their email and password via Firebase authentication, or can utilize Google OAuth to login/sign in.

2. **Courses Dashboard**
   - Upon logging in, users are presented with a scrollable carousel of different courses and different Units under each course: A prospective redesign of the courses dashboard of the PESU App.
   - The User can select the topic that he wants to study. Each topic has a summary video along with relevant course content/slides.
  
3. **Context-Aware Chatbot**
   - The chatbot utilizes video and slide transcriptions stored in a vector database, providing accurate and context-specific answers to student queries.
   - A separate backend service converts each topic's summary video (audio to text using deepgram), and slides into vector embeddings. It stores them in a .faiss file so the chatbot is context-aware of that specific topic.

4. **Advanced Query Processing**
   - Using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 turbo, student questions are matched with relevant content through FAISS, minimizing errors and enhancing the learning experience.

## Tech-Used

- **Frontend:** Flutter - An open source cross-platform UI framework, using which the beautiful screens of bh.AI were built
- **Backend:** FastAPI - Backend for the app, uses Python, performs RAG embeddings on content as well as queries the LLM using system and user prompts
- **langchain:** Framework to integrate LLMs customized for different use Cases
- **FAISS(Facebook AI Similarity Search):** A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- **OpenAI Embeddings:** Used to created an information-dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text.
- **deepgram:** Audio to Text ML model
- **AI Querying:** GPT 3.5 - The most popular LLM today.
- **Authentication:** Firebase - Backend as a Service software used to manage user authentication.
- **Ngrok:** Helps developers expose their local development server to the internet.
